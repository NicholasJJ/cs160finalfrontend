# Important note
Some setup is required to run this repo and get it to display properly. You can follow the guide here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aN8cACq-80_lYWVOWfwNBKSdrjG-p7nR0o11nH7k6SY/edit?usp=sharing

Unfortunatly, since our team only used MacOS, we don't have a setup guide for Windows/Linux (and apparently setting up some of the backend libraries is really hard on Windows). If you're trying to to run this on Windows/Linux, good luck!
